# Seattle-Crime-Heatmap
Data on the 911 incident responses came from the "Seattle Police Department 911 Incident Response" file https://data.seattle.gov/.

Data was preprocessed using Python and the map was created using Leaflet and the simpleheat leaflet plugin.

Take a look at the map here: http://igortal.github.io/Seattle-Crime-Heatmap/
